# Marine SDM

clear project description, setup instructions, and a usage guide.
detailed enough for others to replicate your environment and run the scripts successfully.

## Code Quality
We follow the `tidyverse` style guide for R and `PEP8` for Python

## Originality
This code base was created as part of the "Hack for a Liveable Planet - Biodiversity Hackathon"
We use a number of open-source libraries, all of which are clearly discernible from the way they are loaded in the code.

## Scalability

Known limitations:


Potential areas for further development:
* Modularize workflow from current linear markdown flow to utility functions grouped by topics
* Migrate code to an R package
* Add unit tests
